# 2. Overall Project Description

## 2.1 User Needs

The primary user needs addressed by LeadsCalendar include:

- **Streamlined Event Creation**: Users require a simple and efficient process for creating events without the need to navigate through multiple platforms or interfaces.
- **Integrated Payment Processing**: Users seek the ability to seamlessly process payments for event registrations within the application, eliminating the need for separate payment gateways.
- **Synchronization with Google Calendar**: Users rely on synchronization with Google Calendar to manage their event schedules and ensure consistency across platforms.

## 2.2 Assumptions and Dependencies

LeadsCalendar operates under the following assumptions and dependencies:

- **API Integration**: The successful integration of Google Calendar, PayPal, and Binance Pay APIs is essential for enabling event creation and payment processing functionalities.
- **Internet Connectivity**: Users must have access to stable internet connectivity to utilize the application effectively, as it relies on cloud-based services for functionality.
- **User Authentication**: The application assumes users will authenticate using their existing Google credentials to access the event creation and synchronization features.
- **Currency Exchange Rates**: The application assumes real-time currency exchange rates will be obtained from reliable sources to calculate cryptocurrency equivalents of payments made in USD.
- **Security Measures**: The application depends on robust security measures to protect user data, payment transactions, and API integrations from unauthorized access or breaches.
